Lithium Angular Goodies
=========

This library will provide a few Angular features (directives, etc.) for use with Lithium.

Document Table Directive
The document table directive is useful for index listings and pagination of documents.
Say you want to have a table that lists all the users in your application with the ability
to sort, search, and paginate. This will allow you to render the widget right on the page
with one line in your Lithium view template.

```<doctable></doctable>```
